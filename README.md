E2EE (End-to-End Encrypted) Application with Spring Boot and MongoDB Atlas

This project is a secure and scalable web application developed using Spring Boot and MongoDB Atlas. It implements end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to ensure that data transmitted between clients and servers remains encrypted and secure. Spring Security is utilized to secure endpoints and enforce access control policies, providing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

The application serves as a platform for securely storing and sharing sensitive information, such as personal data, documents, or messages, while maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Users can interact with the application through a user-friendly web interface, accessing various features and functionalities securely.

With MongoDB Atlas as the backend database, the application leverages the scalability and flexibility of MongoDB's document-oriented data model, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of encrypted data. MongoDB Atlas also ensures high availability and data durability, providing a reliable foundation for the application's data storage needs.

Installation:

bash

    git clone https://github.com/MIBGHOST/JournalDB.git

Usage:

    End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):

    All data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
    Messages, documents, and other sensitive information are encrypted on the client-side before being stored or transmitted.
